Feature: User can access index page
  As a user
  In order to get to know more about the platform
  I would like to be able to visit an index page with information about the site

  Scenario:
    When I visit the index page
    Then I should see "Timber"
    And I should see "Social family platform"
    And I should see "Photo sharing"
