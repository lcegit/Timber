### Acceptance test
Acceptance test are written in Cucumber using Capybara and Selenium with Chrome Driver in headless state.

Features are stored in `./features`

To run the acceptance test suite, execute Cucumber in you terminal:

```bash
$ cucumber
```

### Unit tests
#### React Components
This project makes use of React components to offer a rich user experience.

Unit tests for React components are stored in `app/javascript/components/tests`

A sample component with a test can look like this:
```javascript
import React, {Component} from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Hello {this.props.greeting}</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

HelloWorld.propTypes = {
  greeting: PropTypes.string
};

export default HelloWorld
```

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import HelloWorld from '../HelloWorld';
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';
import {mount} from 'enzyme'


Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });

let wrapper;

describe('<HelloWorld />', ()=>{
    beforeEach(() => {
        wrapper = mount(<HelloWorld greeting={'Thomas'}/>);
    });

    it('displays contact name', () => {
        expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Thomas');
    });

});
```

A full list of Jest Matchers can be found on the [Jest reference docs.](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html)

_[TODO: Add description of testing strategies. Are you using factories? Shoulda matchers? etc...]_


#### API Endpoints
API endpoints are tested using RSpec (request specs)

_[TODO: Add description of testing strategies. Are you using fixtures? How do you call your url's (using helpers or referencing them a static url's)? etc...]_
